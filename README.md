To send messages to the application copy the content of the contracts folder as well as the content of the scripts folder in the corresponding folders in your local remix installation. After you did this you can change your remix enviroment to Injected Provider and then manually run the js script called: runthisscript. This deploys a contract and starts the message sending to the UI. To make the messages acually appear in the UI you need to create your our PUSH-Protocol channel and add the smartcontracts address to the delegates list.
